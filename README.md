## Browser Support
This project works in all browsers that natively support the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following browsers have built-in support:

- Chrome (macOS, GNU/Linux, Android & Windows)
- Opera (macOS, GNU/Linux, Windows)
- Android WebView component (KitKat and above)
- Edge (Windows)

For more info, including on how to support Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari see the [WebMidi docs](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi#browser-support)

> Starting with version 77, [Chrome deprecates Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). This means that, going forward, the page will need to be hosted on a secure origin (e.g. https://, localhost: or file:///) and the user will need to explicitely authorize usage (no matter if sysex is used or not).

## Limitations

- **Generated code must be in ES5.** We use [JS Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter) to run code in a sandboxed environment which only supports ES5, but we will be providing ES6 support soon!

# Setup

## WordPress

- Install a vanilla [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site (I use [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) to do this quickly)
- [Download this theme package]() and install it into your site at `/wp-admin/themes.php`

## Menus

Create at least the following pages and/or menu items and add them to the `Main Nav Panel` menu location:

```bash
/
/studio
/factory
/library
```

- Add [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) classes (`fas fa-home`) and descriptions. You may need to enable Classes and Descriptions from the Menu Edit screen by clicking <kbd>Screen Options</kbd> and enable them to see these options

## API
```bash
# Override the api baseurl (useful for testing between enviroments)
?apiDomain=https://example.com
```
